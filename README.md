DATA ARCHIVE - Survey Data Analyses: Non Probability Sample
===

This repo features the data processing, analyses and viszualisation of the relationship between COVID-19 cases and social contacts in the UK.
The main focus of this project is to investigate the effect of nonprobability samples as for sampling puroposes to make inferences about a whole population the population estimates need to be considered.

---

For viszualisation purposes and to emphasize the relationship between the amount of social contacts and the amount of COVID-19 cases several data sets are retrieved. 

---

This repository also features the report regarding the results of the non-probability estimation as well as the evaluation of the social contact behavior in the UK
